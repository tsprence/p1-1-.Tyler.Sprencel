Issues with current design:
  1. Call button is placed very high up
  2. Uncentered design (symmetric design is more appealing)
  
Is this elevator good or bad?
  Current design is simple but flawed. Miscellaneous buttons should all be grouped together, and the call button should not be placed so high as to make it 
  difficult for those in wheelchairs to reach. Floor buttons are skewed to the left for seemingly no intended purpose. With a touch screen it is possible to
  make an even more minimalist design to this elevator's button design.
