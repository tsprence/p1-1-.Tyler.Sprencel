Issues with current design:
  1. Call button is placed very high up
  2. Uncentered design (symmetric design is more appealing)
  
Is this elevator good or bad?
  Current design is simple but flawed. Miscellaneous buttons should all be grouped together, and the call button should not be placed so high as to make it 
  difficult for those in wheelchairs to reach. Floor buttons are skewed to the left for seemingly no intended purpose. With a touch screen it is possible to
  make an even more minimalist design to this elevator's button design.
  
Common uses of an elevator:
  1. Move from one floor to another floor.
  2. Close the doors immediately.
  3. Open the doors immediately.
 
Rare uses of an elevator:
  1. Call for help if stuck.
  2. Set off the alarm for help.

Does the interface makes doing these common things easier? While the floors are displayed prominently, there is much that could have been done to make the
design better. Things such as centering the floor buttons would make for a more appealing design.

What are the common sequence of actions? Most people will hit the button to go the floor that they want to go to, press the button the close the doors, and
after they reach the floor they wanted to go to they will hit every other button and leave.

How does the elevator support the user? For the floor buttons it has a plaque with the floor number next to it, and the miscellaneous buttons have an
understandable symbol to indicate what the button does.

How does the elevator provide feedback? Rings when the elevator has reached its destination and lights up when clicked.

What mistakes could be made with the current design? One could accidently pressed the alarm button instead of the open doors button.

Suggested improvements:
  1. Simplify design with touch screen (put alarm and call button underneath a general help button.)
  2. Ask to verify that user wants to sound the alarm or make a call.
  3. Have a display next to the buttons showing the desination and acknowleding that a button has been pressed with text.
  4. Make alarm button and call button symbols in red.
